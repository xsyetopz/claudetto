# Defects Named in Session 17435f50

Each defect lists its source location (read), the evidence, and a proposed fix. No fix has run yet.

## D1. Path Spam: "The path … was not resolved (HooksError … ENOENT)"

- Source: `plugins/claudetto/hooks/tool.check/useBashRules/own.ts:29-36`. `realPath` calls `$.fs.stat(path, {resolve: true})` and logs through `$.ui.log` on failure. `own.ts:24-28` (`exists`) logs "was not checked".
- Feeds: `files.ts:18-26` `operands(args)` returns every argument that does not start with `-`, so regex patterns, jq filters, URLs, and `gh api` routes get treated as paths. `SHELL_VALUES` (`files.ts:28-38`) covers only `echo`.
- Callers: `recreate.ts:61-80` (`place`), `:133-137` (`bashRecreates`), `:171-190` (`listed`), `:192-217` (`afterBash`); `watch.ts:92` (`gateCheck`) and `:147` (`gateCall`).
- Siblings:
  - `settings.read/useSlimSurface/surface.ts:139-151` (`namesIn`) prints "The directory ~/.claude/commands was not listed" at startup.
  - `plugins/claudetto-openspec/hooks/fs.ts:22-40`.
  - `classic.Stop/useStopChecks/stop.ts:95`.
  - `hygiene/roots.ts:25,64` and `hygiene/sweep.ts:60,147`.
  - `command.run/useSetup/rules.ts:93` (224 records in OpenJoystickDriver).
- Hidden by: `gate.mock.ts:74-105` (`there()` is true for any path with no extension) and `asked.test.ts:45`, which stubs `ui.log`.
- Fix: treat ENOENT as an answer ("absent") and log nothing. Resolve only operands of commands whose operand is a path. Make the mock report absent paths as absent.

## D2. Status Line Has No Colour Until the First Measured Turn

- Source: `plugins/claudetto/statusline/main.ts:50-51` (`themeOf = colorOff(env) ? undefined : theme`), `color.ts:82-85` (`colorOff` checks only `NO_COLOR`), `color.ts:116-121` (`paintOf` returns plain text when the theme is undefined), `local.ts:152-169` (`readLine`).
- The theme comes from the line file, which `hooks/session.measure/useLineFile/line-file.ts:10-31` writes only after the first measured turn. Until then the theme is undefined and the line is plain.
- The spec says so on purpose: `openspec/specs/status-line/spec.md:251-254`, "No Theme File … paints with no colour". The user calls that a defect.
- Fix: paint the `dark` palette when no theme is known, unless `NO_COLOR` is set.

## D3. Bun Rules Hard-Baked Into Hooks

- `hooks/texts.ts:17`: the root prompt always says "in a bun repo, use bun and bunx, never npm…".
- `texts.ts:151`: `bun pm ls` hint.
- `tool.check/useBashRules/packages.ts:5-83`: denies npm-family commands when `bun.lock` exists (`BUN_FOR_NPM`, `NPM_FAMILY`), with no way to turn it off.
- `surface.ts:220-241`: `BUN_FACT` behind `bunRuleEnabled` (`plugin.json:28`). This is a second path for the same job.
- Others: `skills/docs/SKILL.md:6-7` (`bunx ctx7`), `setup.ts:161`, `settings.ts:22,221`, and `starter-families.ts:38-76`. The `bin/*` shebangs need Bun as the runtime, which is a separate and legitimate dependency.
- Fix: detect the package manager (the `packageManager` field, then lock files). Name it once in a SessionStart fact for any manager. Drop the Bun line from the prompt and the npm deny table.

## D4. Files Acting as Folders

Clusters of three or more files with a shared prefix in one folder:

- `classic.Stop/useStopChecks/open-items*`
- `command.run/useSetup/setup*`, `ignore*`, `settings*`, `starter*`
- `tool.check/useBashRules/shell-words*` (the `reading2`–`reading6` tests), `rules*` (`rules.generated.ts` beside the `rules.generated/` folder), `gate*`, `processes*`
- `agent.spawn/useMemoryHold/memory*`, `hold*`
- `tool.call/useDecideTool/decide*`
- `classic.Stop/useSliceCommits/slices*`
- `prompt.submit/useConstraintPin/pin*`
- `verify*`, `tool.call/useBudgetRun/budget*`, `useClaudettoAgents/delegation*`
- hooks root `texts*` and `cleanup*`
- `plugins/claudetto-you-should-know/hooks/register*` (8 files)
- `plugins/claudetto-openspec/hooks/openspec*`, `spec-*` (7), `validate-*` (5)
- `tools/hygiene/trash*`, `tools/claim-check-*`, `tools/decider-*`
- `tests/claudetto-openspec/fixture-*`, `fixtures/specs-apply.*.json`, `validation.*.json`

Constraints on a move:

- `bunfig.toml:29` ignores `plugins/**/*.test.ts`.
- `project.just:36` `lab` runs `claude plugin test plugins/<each>`.
- `register.ts:32-65` loads hook modules by path.

## D5. Hook Texts and Forms

- `output-styles/Concise.md:19,27` gives a `sudo` example, which cannot run because the `!` shell has no TTY. `Concise.md` writes `- [ ] !` where the Stop hook wants `- !`.
- `texts-gate.ts:74` (Read not shell), `:85` (Write not shell), `:106` (pkill), `:111` (pid), `:127` (worktree), `:131` (loop with no time limit); `kill.ts:17-18,51,81-121`. Together these cause most denials in `sessions.md` §3.
- `texts.ts:51` (uncommitted list), `:225` ("A Stop hook blocked and no file changed"), `:242-249` (the `- ! <command>` form).
- `open-items.ts:11-20`; `texts-grade.ts:11,23,26,30,31,34,35`.

## D6. Leftovers From the 2.1.319 Issue List

Fixed in 2.1.321: the answer-first gate, the `/tmp` marker, installing into `/tmp`, and busy-wait loops.

Still open:

- `$.ui.log` on ENOENT (D1).
- `kill $VAR` refused.
- A subagent's leftover pid.
- Loops bounded by a counter or `date` still denied.
- Stop flags copied task text.

Prompt gaps:

- `! /skill` suggested as a shell command.
- Pinning an older dependency ("you were not supposed to pin to older typescript-bedrock.").
- Invented `.invalid` URLs.
- Asking for an API key instead of OAuth ("WHY WOULD YOU ASK FOR API_KEY???").
- "Not checked" laziness ("this is disgusting laziness. keep going.").

Sandbox gaps: iOS simulator and `openpty`.

## D7. Agent Files

- `agents/plan.md:4` and `search.md:4` use `model: claude-sonnet-5-5` with no `effort`.
- `sweep.md:4-5` uses `model: fable` and `effort: high`.
- `work.md` sets no model, effort, or tools.
- `plugins/claudetto/settings.json:2` sets `subagentStatusLine`, which 2.1.323 removed.
