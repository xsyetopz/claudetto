## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: A Machine Short of Memory Holds New Work

Before each `Bash` or `Monitor` call and each subagent start, the system SHALL read the machine's free memory share, and below `memoryFreeMinPercent` (a `userConfig` option, default 20, 0 off) SHALL deny the call with a reason that names the free share and the five largest processes by pid and size and tells the agent to stop its own runs and wait. A command that is read-only, or whose every program is `kill`, SHALL pass. Where the share cannot be read, the call SHALL pass.

#### Scenario: Low Memory

- **WHEN** the free share is below the limit and a `Bash` call runs `bunx oxlint src/a.ts`
- **THEN** the call is denied, and the reason names the share and the largest processes

#### Scenario: Low Memory, a Kill

- **WHEN** the free share is below the limit and a `Bash` call runs `kill 4242` or `ps -ax`
- **THEN** the call goes on

#### Scenario: Low Memory, a Subagent

- **WHEN** the free share is below the limit and a subagent starts
- **THEN** the start is denied with the same reason

#### Scenario: Enough Memory, or the Limit Off

- **WHEN** the free share is at or above the limit, or `memoryFreeMinPercent` is 0, or the platform gives no share
- **THEN** the call goes on

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: A Closing Stop Removes the Session's Leftovers

At each stop of the lead, the system SHALL remove the agent worktrees that nothing needs, as `session-hygiene` defines them. When no task of the agent runs, it SHALL also remove the worktrees and branches the agent created, with plain `git worktree remove` and `git branch -d`, so what holds work stays. It SHALL block once to name what stays of what the agent or a worker it started made, unless the reply names each. A stop SHALL NOT name another session's agent worktree; the hygiene report does.

#### Scenario: A Dirty Worktree

- **WHEN** a worktree the agent added holds uncommitted changes and its branch has an unmerged commit
- **THEN** both stay and the Stop names them
- **AND** the lab test is `cleanup.test.ts`, "an integrated worker worktree and a merged branch go; a dirty worktree, an unmerged branch, and a worker worktree with new commits stay and the stop names them"

#### Scenario: Another Session's Worker

- **WHEN** an unlocked agent worktree holds a commit the lead's branch lacks and no `Agent` call of this session started its worker
- **THEN** the worktree stays and the Stop passes without naming it
- **AND** the lab test is `cleanup.test.ts`, "a worker worktree with new commits that this session did not start stays and the stop does not name it"

#### Scenario: Workers Still Run

- **WHEN** the lead stops while a background worker runs and another worker's unlocked worktree holds only commits the lead's branch has
- **THEN** that worktree and its branch are removed, and the Stop names nothing
- **AND** the lab test is `cleanup.test.ts`, "an integrated worker worktree goes while another worker still runs"
